# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements **Credit Card Fraud Detection** using **Machine Learning** techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling) are used to improve fraud detection accuracy.

## 📂 Project Overview

🔹 **Goal**: Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.  
🔹 **Dataset**: Kaggle’s Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Highly Imbalanced).  
🔹 **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.  
🔹 **Techniques Applied**: SMOTE, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning.  

## 📊 **Dataset Description**
- **Time**: Seconds elapsed between transactions.  
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.  
- **Class**: Target variable (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud).  

## 🛠️ **Installation**
To run this project locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CreditCard-FraudDetection.git
cd CreditCard-FraudDetection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 **Project Workflow**
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
✔️ Handling Missing Values  
✔️ Feature Engineering (Creating new features like transaction velocity)  
✔️ Data Scaling (StandardScaler applied to Amount & Time)  

### **2️⃣ Handling Imbalance with SMOTE**
✔️ Oversampling the minority class to improve fraud detection  

### **3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation**
✔️ Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
✔️ Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC Score**  

## 📈 **Results**
- **Best Model**: Random Forest  
- **ROC-AUC Score**: **0.98**  
- **Key Observations**:
  - SMOTE improved fraud detection significantly.
  - Feature Engineering enhanced model accuracy.

## 💡 **How to Use**
- Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook CreditCard-FraudDetection.ipynb
```
- Modify hyperparameters in `model_training.py` to experiment with different models.
